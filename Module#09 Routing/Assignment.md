Module#09 - Assignment / Module-level checks

Complete the following after you finish each project assignment:

1) For each project, write a 2-3 sentence summary explaining what you learned and one change you made while testing.

2) Cross-project question: Compare how `LinkGenerator` (M06) and `IOutboundParameterTransformer` (M07) help with URL management. Give one concrete use-case for each.

3) Practical task: Create a tiny script or collection of `curl`/`http` requests that demonstrates:
   - getting a product list from M01,
   - requesting an order from M06 and following the returned edit link,
   - generating a book URL with M07.

4) Final check: Start each project and paste the exact `curl`/request output you got for one endpoint from each project.

When complete, mark this Assignment file with short answers and a note about any issues you encountered.
