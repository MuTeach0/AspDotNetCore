M01.RoutingBasics - Assignment / Check your understanding

1) Explain in a sentence: What is the difference between the minimal endpoints defined in `Program.cs` and the controller routes in `ProductsController.cs`?

Answer: 


2) Which attribute determines the base path for `ProductsController`? How would you change the path from `/products` to `/catalog`?

Answer: 


3) Add a new POST endpoint to `ProductsController` that accepts a product name and returns 201 Created. (Implement in code)

4) Run the app and hit `/rout-table`. List three endpoints you see and explain where each is defined (file/line).

5) Extra: Modify one minimal endpoint in `Program.cs` to return a custom header; describe what you changed.

When done, paste short answers or code snippets here and run the app to confirm behavior.
