Module#09 - Routing

This module contains three small demo projects exploring ASP.NET Core routing features:
- `M01.RoutingBasics` - controllers + minimal endpoints.
- `M06.LinkGeneratirs` - LinkGenerator and named routes for HATEOAS-style links.
- `M07.ParameterTransformers` - outbound parameter transformers (slugify example).

Prerequisites
- .NET 9 SDK (or the version used in the projects). Verify with:
  dotnet --version

How to run a project
- Open a terminal and `cd` into one of the project folders (e.g., `M01.RoutingBasics`) and run `dotnet run`.

Folder contents
- Each project folder contains its own `Program.cs`, optional controllers/transformers, and a `request.http` file you can use for quick testing.

Module exercises
- Each project contains an `Assignment.md` with questions and small tasks to validate your understanding. Complete them and record answers in those files.
