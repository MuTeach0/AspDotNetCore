# API Versioning Module Assignment

## Objective
Demonstrate your understanding of different API versioning strategies in ASP.NET Core by completing the following tasks.

## Tasks

### 1. Versioning Strategy Analysis
- Compare and contrast the four versioning strategies covered in this module
- List pros and cons of each approach
- Explain when each strategy would be most appropriate

### 2. Implementation Exercise
Create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project that implements:
- At least two different versioning strategies
- Support for both current (v1) and future (v2) versions
- Proper version deprecation notices
- API documentation that reflects the versioning

### 3. Version Negotiation
Implement a sample API that:
- Supports multiple versions of the same endpoint
- Handles version fallback scenarios
- Implements proper error handling for unsupported versions
- Uses appropriate response headers for version information

### 4. Testing and Documentation
- Create a Postman/request.http collection demonstrating all version scenarios
- Document the API using OpenAPI/Swagger
- Include version deprecation notices
- Write integration tests for version selection

### 5. Practical Questions

1. How would you handle breaking changes in your API?
2. What strategy would you use for version number selection?
3. How would you implement API sunset policies?
4. What considerations would you make for backward compatibility?
5. How would you document API changes between versions?

## Submission Requirements

1. Working code implementation
2. Documentation of your versioning strategy
3. Test cases demonstrating version selection
4. Written answers to practical questions
5. Reflection on the benefits and drawbacks of your chosen approach
